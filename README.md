# ColorPicker
## In this release I am using
**Third-party packages:**
- Udar (Inspector SceneField serializer)
- JoystickPack (modified)
- DOTween
- PlayerPrefsEditor
- Programming patterns:

**StateMachine**
- Factory
- ServiceLocator
- Object pooling
- Composition

**Optimization features:**
- Factory (for the better performance when creating many objects)
- Sprite atlases (reducing DrawCalls)
- Canvas separation (reducing canvas refresh when it changes)
